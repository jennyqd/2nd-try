# 2nd-try
Failed first attempt. Let's try this again. 

Created my git account a long time ago. 
The default SSH expired and was apparently removed. 
The tutorial didn't say anything about it so I followed the documentation below to set things up: 

https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

- Generated a key on my local machine
- Set up a passkey
- Added the public key to github

Then everything worked as it should.
